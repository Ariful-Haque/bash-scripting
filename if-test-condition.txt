# Normally, 'if' statement can only evaluate 'Shell Commands' and
# if the command returns zero exit status code, then 'if' block is run.
# otherwise else block.

if ls -d /home/user; then
 echo ......
else
 echo .......

# But using test command or test condition [] it can evaluate any condition
# just like other programing languages. If the condition is true, the test condition
# exit with a zero exit status code.


## Test condition can evaluate three classes of condition

 - Numeric Comparision
 - String Comparision
 - File Comparision

var=4
if [$var1 -gt 2]; then
  echo ......
else
  echo ......

# you can not use floating-point for test condition, only integer.
